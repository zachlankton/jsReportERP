# jsReportERP

This was a custom ERP style application built on top of a jsreport installation that I customized to work as a platform for building applications. [See jsReport.net](https://jsreport.net).  The backend database used is Couchbase.  Handlebars Server Side Rendering of templates was used heavily including some unique helper methods that were designed to make writing the application more declarative.  No frontend frameworks were used.  This was intentional and I believe resulted in a very manageable codebase.
